# synchronous-client-server

After learning a little bit about how socket programming works in C, I decided to implement
whatever knowledge I gained using a more modern language (C#).

  ->  Written on Visual Studio 2019.
  ->  All of the code was written down based on documentation from Microsoft.
  ->  The string message that is being sent has been hardcoded into the code.
  ->  Use Console.Readline() to read in user message to be echoed back from the server.
